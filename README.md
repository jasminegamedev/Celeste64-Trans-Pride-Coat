# Installation

To install simply copy and paste the Models folder into the games Content folder. If it asks you to overwrite the player.glb file, say yes.

# Changing to normal

To revert to the default skin, open the models folder and delete or rename the player.glb file, then rename the player_default.glb file to just player.glb
